Hello,
 
 This is the part of my day to day learning. 
 The only way to improve the efficiency of a programmer is by writing. Writing, playing with `codes `and `errors`. I write about Software Engineering, Machine learning, Artificial intelligence & Data Structure and algorithms and in  language and framework like python, Ruby, Django and rails.

 I am the `codeblooded` organism.
